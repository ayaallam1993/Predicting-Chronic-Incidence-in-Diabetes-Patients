# Predicting-Chronic-Incidence-in-Diabetes-Patients
This project aims to predict whether a patient with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is at risk of developing chronic complications. The dataset includes various patient-related features such as demographics, laboratory results, and medical history. Using machine learning models, we analyze these factors and build a predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following key features:

Gender: Male or Female.
Religion & Nationality: Categorical data that was preprocessed.
Avg_HBA1C Results: Average Hemoglobin A1C test results.
HBA1C Test Compliance: Compliance with HBA1C testing recommendations.
D_Of_Birth: Date of birth, converted to age.
Diagnosis_Type: Type of diabetes diagnosis (all are Type II).
Acute_flag: Indicates if the patient had acute complications.
ER_flag_bef_chronic & # ER_befor_Chr: Emergency room visits before chronic complications.
IP_flag_bef_chr & # IP_bef_chr: Inpatient admissions before chronic complications.
OP_Bef_chr: Number of outpatient visits before chronic complications.
Comorbidity: Presence of pre-existing conditions.
Various chronic conditions: Includes hypertension, obesity, stroke, etc.
